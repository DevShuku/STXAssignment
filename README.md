# STXAssignment Solution
Source code is placed at GitHub https://github.com/DevShuku/STXAssignment

It is a source code for designing and implementing a microservice architecture for the given 
requirement as below.
Requirements:
Code Development:
1. Create two APIs for each module: Customer, Supplier, and Meetings.
2. The first API will retrieve the count of records, such as the number of customers.
3. The second API will retrieve a list of records, providing details for each customer.
4. Create an API to display a list of trade transactions based on their IDs, 
referencing the Figma document. Ensure that the status reflects the trade flow, 
indicating whether it's rejected or approved as per the trade flow documents.

üì¢ This project is built with **.net 8.0

## Swagger Page
  https://localhost:7053/swagger/v1/swagger.json

## Tech stack 
   - Dotnet core 8.0

## Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
The static dataset is used for the all the endpoints. There is **no database implementation** since the time constraints , If time permits I would try to add some MSSQL implementation as part of database.  

## How to run the project?
On pre installed **Visual Studio 2022** (It is the latest as of May,2024). Now, follow the following steps.
1. Open command prompt. Go to a directory where you want to clone this project. Use this command to clone the project.
   ```
     git clone https://github.com/DevShuku/STXAssignment.git
   ```
2. Go to the directory where you have cloned this project, open the directory `STXAssignment`. You will find a file with name `STXAssignment.sln`. Double click on this file and this project will be opened in Visual Studio.
## Since there is no database connection we can skip this part else the below is a vital step  
3.  open `appsettings.json` file and update connection string
 
   ```
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "conn": "data source=your_server_name;initial catalog=MovieStoreMvc; integrated security=true;encrypt=false"
     }
   ```
4. Now you can run this project

Thanks a lot üôÇüôÇ
